# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Exercise

Welcome to your second JavaScript exercise! This time, you'll be using your JS skills to interact with and modify an HTML document. This is known as Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.

## Your Task

Your task is to implement a series of functions in the index.js file. Each function is designed to make a specific change to the index.html file. Read the comments in index.js carefully to understand what each function needs to do.

You will be practicing:

- Selecting elements by ID, class, and tag name.
- Changing the content and style of elements.
- Creating new elements and adding them to the page.
- Adding attributes to elements.
- Removing elements from the page.
